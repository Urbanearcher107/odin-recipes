    <h2>Wood fired Neapolitan style margherita pizza</h2>
    Neapolitan pizza is simple yet delicious. Made with just a few
    high quality ingredients cooked to perfection. The final result is 
    light and fresh pizza that tastes great.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 cups bread flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>Cooking spray, or olive oil</li>
        <li>1 14-ounce can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>12 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch slices or torn into small chunks</li>
        <li>2 ounces fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        Make the dough
        <li>Combine the flour, salt, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the water and mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on low speed for 10 minutes. The mixture should come together into a unified mass 
            that barely sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. If the dough is sticking, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to the mixer while it is running, 
            until the mass barely sticks to the bowl. If the mixture is too dry, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to the running mixer.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8-72 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and divide into 4 balls.</li>
        <li>Let dough balls rise at room tempature for 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        Make the sauce
        <li>Pulse the tomatoes in a food processor until a chunky liquid is formed</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        Assemble the pizza
        <li>Heat the oven to at least 475 F higher if your oven allows.</li>
        <li>Onto a well-floured surface, stretch out each ball of dough into a 10-inch circle. 
            Use a floured rolling pin if you need to. Don't worry about the dough being a perfect circle.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a pizza peel making sure to cover where the dough will sit. 
            Place one rolled-out piece of dough onto the peel and shake gently to ensure that the dough is not sticking.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1/3 cup of sauce over the dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch of the edge bare.</li>
        <li>Top the sauce with 1/4 of the mozzarella slices. Tear a few basil leaves and place them on top (according to your liking),
             and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. You can also add the basil and olive oil after the pizza is cooked.</li> 
        <li>Transfer the pizza from peel to the hotstone</li>
        <li>Bake until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is charred</li> 
        <li>Repeat with remaining dough and enjoy.</li>
     </ol>
